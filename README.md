       - REDIS_HOST=redis
       - REDIS_PORT=6379
       - ADMIN_SECRET=admin_secret
       - JWT_SECRET=jwt_secret
       - JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=jwt_refresh_secret
       ```
3. run docker

     - `GET /users` : get all users ( admin only )
     - `GET /users/:id` : get user by id ( admin only )
     - `PATCH /users/:id` : update user by id ( admin only )
     - `DELETE /users/:id` : delete user by id ( admin only )
   - courses
     - `GET /courses` : check all courses
     - `GET /courses/:id` check course by id
     - `GET /courses/myCourse` : check my course

     - `DELETE /enrollments/:id` : delete enrollment ( student ( enroll owner ), teacher ( course advisor ) and admin only )
     - `GET /enrollments/myEnrollment`: get my enrollment
7. Authentication
